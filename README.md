# Mercury Android

Mercury is an application to be used by volunteers at CodeDoesGood (CDG) to store contact and project information. Volunteers of all types (business, design, development, etc) will benefit from using the application as it will help users stay up to date on any projects or tasks being worked on. 

Instead of project announcements potentially being lost or overlooked on Slack, Project Organizers will have the ability to broadcast announcements to all team members on a project, and review which team members read the announcement. Users will be able to view all projects, project details, and express interest in upcoming projects. Joining projects will help users stay informed of all subtasks related to a project as well as view project updates and other team members on the project.

## Contributing

For now you may experience an issue building due to missing the Crashlytics API key. If so, please reach out in the 'proj-volunteerwebapp' channel and we can get the information to you.
